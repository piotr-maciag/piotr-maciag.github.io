**Piotr** graduated with distinction in Computer Science obtaining his MSc from Rzeszów University of Technology and subsequently obtainint PhD with distinction from Warsaw University of Technology. His research interests are with data mining and machine learning: discovering sequential patterns from spatio-temporal data, mining frequent itemsets, associative rules mining and associative classification, classification and regression models, spiking neural networks, time series processing, logical databases, clustering and their applications to such areas as air pollution prediction or crime incidents analysis. In academic year 2017/2018, he was a research visitor in Knowledge Engineering and Discovery Research Institute (KEDRI) at Auckland University of Technology, where he was working under supervision of Professor Nikola Kasabov on novel prediction methods using spiking neural networks. In January and February 2019, he was visiting OPTIMA research group lead by Professor Javier Del Ser Lorente at Tecnalia Research and Innovation in Basque Country, where he was working on anomaly detection in time series data. From October to December 2019 he visited Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. Rector’s Award in Science (2021).
