You can find up-to-date list of my research publications at the DBLP database: [https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/200/0320.html](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/200/0320.html)

My scientific interests are:

* In data mining - discovering various types of patterns (such as sequential patterns, frequent patterns), developing new representations of concise patterns and applying obtaining results to spatio-temporal data.
* In neural networks - developing new theoretical and learning results in Spiking Neural Networks, SNNs.
* Applying obtained results to such domains as: prediction in time series, anomaly detection, air pollution prediction, text classification.

I am happy to collaborate with other researchers and industrial experts.
